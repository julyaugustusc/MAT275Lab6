# MAT275Lab6
This is a project from MAT 275 - Modern Differential Equations. The code contained from this class may not fully be my own, and should not be used to cheat in future assignments. This has been made public ONLY for the purposes of job searching and perhaps archiving if/when the professor is no longer teaching the class. Please contact me if there is a problem and this needs to be taken down, thank you.
